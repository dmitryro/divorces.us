<h3><strong>Agreements</strong></h3></section>
<section class="published-paragraph">
<p>A divorce may occur under the terms of an agreement.  Such an agreement is a written contract between the two parties to the divorce that provides for the division of money, and property, spousal support, and the care and custody of children.  Furthermore, the parties may enter into an agreement before a marriage, during a marriage, or before the dissolution of a marriage regarding the disposition of marital assets in the event of a divorce.
</p><p>In this post, we provide a very brief overview of agreements in New York and New Jersey. Any individual case will present a unique set of issues.</p>

<h4><strong>New York Divorce Ground for Separation Agreement</strong>
</h4>
</section>
<section class="published-paragraph">
<p>One of New York’s seven legal grounds for divorce involves an agreement.  NY Dom Rel L sec. 170 (2016) explains that if the husband and wife have lived separate and apart for one or more years under the terms of a separation agreement, and the plaintiff establishes that he or she performed all of the terms of the agreement, this may be used as a ground for divorce.

<h4><strong>Agreements Made Before or During a Marriage</strong></h4>
</section>
<section class="published-paragraph">
<p>NY&nbsp;Dom Rel L sec. 236 (2016)&nbsp;explains that an agreement made between the parties before or during a marriage will be valid so long as it is in writing, subscribed to by the parties, and properly recorded as a deed. &nbsp;Such agreements may include, but are not limited to:</p>
<section class="shift-right">
<ul>
<li>Contract to make a testamentary provision;&nbsp;<br></li>
<li>A waiver of any right to elect against the provisions of a will;<br></li><li>Provision for the ownership, division, or distribution of separate and marital property;<br></li><li>Provision for the amount and duration of maintenance (alimony)&nbsp;or other terms and conditions of the marital relationship; or<br></li><li>Provision for child custody or support.<br></li></ul>

<section class="published-paragraph">
<p>New Jersey has similar laws at NJ Rev Stat 37:2-34 (2016). &nbsp;Under these provisions, a premarital (or pre-civil union)&nbsp;agreement may include:</p>
<section class="shift-right">
<ul><li>The rights or obligations of each party to the property of either party or both parties;</li><li>The right to manage or control property;</li><li>The disposition of property upon separation, marital dissolution, the death of one of the parties, or the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any other event;</li><li>The modification or elimination of support;</li><li>The making of a will or trust;</li><li>The ownership rights and disposition of a death benefit or life insurance policy;</li><li>The choice of law governing the construction of the agreement; or</li><li>Any other matter that is not a violation of public policy.</li></ul>

<section class="published-paragraph">

<p>One party may argue that such an agreements is unenforceable. If a party establishes that he or she did not have the opportunity to consult with legal counsel, an agreement may be found to be unenforceable. Furthermore, if one party was not forthright about his or her earnings, property, and/or financial obligations when entering into the agreement, the agreement may be found to be unenforceable. Finally, if one party establishes that he or she entered into the agreement under duress, the agreement may be found to be unenforceable. The burden will be upon the party alleging that the agreement is unenforceable to establish such. For example, in NJ Rev Stat sec. 37:2-38 (2016), the burden is on the party alleging the agreement is unenforceable to prove such by “clear and convincing evidence.”<br></p><h4><strong>Agreements in Lieu of Proceedings</strong></h4></section>
<section class="published-paragraph">
<p>In seeking a divorce, the parties may seek to resolve their disagreements by way of coming to an agreement, sometimes through the formal process of divorce mediation.  Coming to an agreement may spare the parties from months of litigation in contested divorce proceedings.  While such an agreement may not be the appropriate resolution in every situation, it is worth considering by the parties and their attorneys whether it is possible to resolve disputed issues without a court order.

<h4><strong>Note on Custody of the Children</strong>
</h4>
</section>
<section class="published-paragraph">
<p>Notwithstanding any agreements, a judge is required to consider, first and foremost, the best interests of the child in making any child custody determinations.  While a judge will consider any agreements entered into between the parties concerning the custody and support of children, he or she will still have the discretion to render an order contrary to the agreement if such would serve the best interests of the child.

<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong>
</h4>
</section>
<section class="published-paragraph">
<p>When entering into an agreement with a spouse or fiancée, it is wise to consult with an experienced family law.  Firstly, if an agreement is not well-written with respect to the relevant laws of the state, it may do little to resolve the issues.  Secondly, if there is a lack of regularity in the process of entering into an agreement, this may lead to one party challenging its validity and enforceability at a later date.  Finally, an attorney may help his or her client review the agreement carefully to ensure that the client understand all it entails.  At The Law Offices of Grinberg &amp; Segal, PLLC, we have extensive experience in reviewing agreements, helping parties reach agreements (before or during marriage as well as after the commencement of a divorce action), and ensuring that the rights and interests of our clients are protected.
