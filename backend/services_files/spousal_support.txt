<h3>Spousal Support</h3><p><strong></strong>Spousal support, or alimony, is the regular payment by one party in a divorce to another to provide financial support during or after a divorce or separation process and/or after a divorce is completed.  The amount of spousal support may be an issue that is agreed upon by the parties in negotiations.  If the parties do not agree and the divorce is contested, a court may order spousal support if it sees fit depending on the specific facts of the case. In this article, we will provide a very brief overview of alimony in New York and New Jersey.</p><h4>Alimony in New York</h4>
</section>
<section class="published-paragraph">
<p>The main statutes concerning alimony in New York are found in NY Dom. Rel. L. sec. 236 (2016).</p><p>New York law provides for "temporary maintenance" payments during divorce proceedings. Temporary maintenance terminates upon the culmination of the proceedings. The parties may reach their own agreement regarding temporary maintenance. &nbsp;However, if no such agreement is reached, the court may order temporary maintenance to be paid by the party with higher income to the party with lower income. The New York Courts website maintains a “Temporary Maintenance Online Calculator” which is based on the temporary maintenance factors outlined in statute. &nbsp;These formulas are designed to prevent the payer from falling below an income level at which he or she can sustain him or herself.</p></section>

<p>New York's statutes also provide for post-divorce maintenance. payments. Alimony to be paid after a divorce is finalized can either be negotiated by the parties or ordered by a court based on the formulas in the New York statutes. In some cases, alimony may be paid as a single sum payment. "Maintenance" is defined as an agreed upon payment schedule, or a court-ordered payment schedule, where support is "paid at fixed intervals for a definite or indefinite payment of time..."</p><p>Post-divorce maintenance is calculated before child support is calculated. It is important to note that notwithstanding divorce maintenance factors, the amount of maintenance awarded cannot reduce the payer's income below the self-support reserve for a single person. Where a court orders maintenance, the duration of such maintenance will generally depend on the length of the marriage.</p><p>Courts have discretion to deviate from the post-divorce maintenance guidelines based on several factors. &nbsp;These factors are listed in statute and paraphrased here:</p><p></p>

</section>



<section class="published-paragraph">
<p>Barring "exceptional circumstances," for cases in New Jersey involving marriages or civil unions that lasted less than 20 years, the duration of alimony will not exceed the length of the marriage or civil union. "Exceptional circumstances" are defined in statute.</p><p>Rehabilitative alimony is awarded based upon a rehabilitation plan of the payee and may be modified. &nbsp;Reimbursement alimony may be awarded "under circumstances in which one party supported the other through an advanced education, anticipating participation in the fruits of the earning capacity generated by that education" and may not be modified under any circumstances. Other types of alimony may be subsequently modified based on specified factors. Alimony will generally terminate upon death, re-marriage, or (in most cases) the retirement of the obligor.</p><p></p></section><section class="published-paragraph"><h4>How We Can Help</h4>
