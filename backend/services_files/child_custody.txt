<h3>Child Custody</h3>
</section> 

<section class="published-paragraph">
<p>One of the most important, and often the most contentious, issues that may arise during divorce negotiations or proceedings is that of child custody.  Child custody can be negotiated through mediation or determined by a judge in the course of divorce or separation proceedings.  Whether through proceedings or through an agreement, there may be a variety of custody arrangements from one parent having sole custody, both parents sharing joint custody, or any other arrangement that is found to be in the best interests of the child.  In most cases, a parent who is not granted joint or sole physical custody of the child will still be able to seek visitation rights.  It is crucial for a parent who is facing divorce to consult immediately with an experienced family law attorney for guidance on how to protect his or her interests as a parent in the course of divorce mediation or divorce proceedings. &nbsp;In this article, we will provide a brief overview of some of the significant child custody provisions in New York and New Jersey.</p>

<h4>Child Custody and Visitation in New York</h4>
</section> 

<section class="published-paragraph">
<p>Under New York law, “custody” has two components.  First there is the concept of “legal custody.”  A parent with legal custody has the right to make decisions regarding the child’s upbringing.  The second concept is “physical custody.”  A parent with physical custody has actual day-to-day physical care and control of a child under the age of 18.
</p>
</section> 
<section class="published-paragraph">
<p>A parent may petition for custody in Family Court, or the issue may be decided in divorce proceedings 
before an order of divorce is granted.  Neither parent is presumed to have a greater right to custody of the child before an assessment of the facts of the case. Under NY Dom Rel L sec. 240 (2016), judges must consider the “best interests of the child” in determining custody and visitation. The statutes provide a detailed list of factors that must be considered in child custody cases. The website for the New York State Unified Court System provides a condensed summary of factors considered by courts in determining custody and visitation (paraphrased):
</p>
</section> 
<section class="published-paragraph">

<section class="shift-right">
<ul><li>Which parent has been the main care giver/nurturer of the child;</li><li>The parenting skills of each parent and the ability of each parent to provide for the child's special needs (when applicable);<br></li><li>The mental and physical health of each parent;<br></li><li>Any instances of domestic violence (when applicable);<br></li><li>The work schedules and care plans of each parent;<br></li><li>The child's relationship with the rest of his or her family;<br></li><li>The wishes of the child (depending on the age of the child); and<br></li><li>Each parent's ability to cooperate with the other parent and encourage a relationship between the child and the other apparent (absent safety concerns).<br></li></ul>
</section>
</section> 
<section class="published-paragraph">

<p>The above list of factors is non-exhaustive, and courts may consider other relevant factors in making decisions in child custody cases. &nbsp;Any instances of domestic violence or other safety concerns will weigh heavily in determining the "best interests of the child" in a given case. &nbsp;The New York Unified Court System makes clear that the paramount concerns in decisions are the "child's health and safety."</p>
</section> 
<section class="published-paragraph">

<p>Before issuing a temporary or permanent custody or visitation order, the court is required to review all related decisions in court proceedings in family court (if applicable) before issuing an order.  In the event a situation requires expeditious action to serve the best interest of the child, the court may issue a temporary emergency order for custody or visitation.

<h4><strong>Child Custody and Visitation in New Jersey</strong></h4>
</section> 
<section class="published-paragraph">

<p>Under NJ Rev Stat sec. 9:2-4 (2016), the public policy of New Jersey is to assure that parents share parental responsibility after separation or divorce.  However, under section 9:2-4A, “the best interest of the child” is a primary consideration “notwithstanding any provisions of the law to the contrary.”  Courts may decide on joint custody, sole custody (with appropriate parenting time for the non-custodial parent), or any other custody arrangement that is determined to be in the best interests of the 
child.  The statute lists the following non-exhaustive list of factors that courts must consider, where applicable, in making a custody determination:
</p>
</section> 
<section class="published-paragraph">
<section class="shift-right">
<ul><li>The parents’ ability to agree, communicate, and cooperate regarding the child;<br></li><li>The parents’ willingness to accept custody and history of unwillingness to allow parenting time not based on substantiated abuse;<br></li><li>The interaction and relationship of the child with [his or her] parents and siblings;<br></li><li>The history of domestic violence, if any;<br></li><li>The safety of the child and the safety of either parent from physical abuse from the other parent;<br></li><li>The preference of the child when of sufficient age and capacity to reason as to form an intelligent decision;<br></li><li>The needs of the child;<br></li><li>The stability of home environment offered;<br></li><li>The quality and continuity of the child’s education;<br></li><li>The fitness of parents;<br></li><li>The geographical proximity of the parents’ homes;<br></li><li>The extent and quality of time spent by each parent with the child prior to or subsequent to the separation;<br></li><li>The parents’ employment responsibilities; and<br></li><li>The age and number of children.<br></li></ul>

<section class="published-paragraph">

<p>The court will not determine a parent to be "unfit" unless his or her conduct has a "substantial adverse effect on the child." &nbsp;Certain sexual assault or contact convictions specified in section 9.2:4-1 preclude a parent from being awarded custody.</p>
</section> 
<section class="published-paragraph">

<p>If the parents reach a custody arrangement, the court will order the arrangement unless it determines that the arrangement is contrary to the best interests of the child.</p><p>If the parents do not agree on an arrangement, the court may require each parent to submit a custody plan to be considered in making a determination.
</p>
</section> 
<section class="published-paragraph">

<p>The court may appoint a guardian or an attorney to represent the best interests of the child.
