<h3><strong>Property</strong></h3>
</section> <section class="published-paragraph">

<p>Property may arise as one of the more significant issues in divorce mediation or divorce proceedings. This is especially true in cases where the value of the property is significant. The parties can execute an agreement regarding property division prior to or during the marriage that will generally control upon termination of the marriage.  Both New York and New Jersey have statutes and adjudicative principles regarding property division. This article will provide a brief introduction to the complicated subject of property division. It is in no way intended to be comprehensive, and each case presents its own specific circumstances.</p>

<h4><strong>Property Division in New York</strong></h4>
</section> <section class="published-paragraph">
<p>New York Law recognizes two different types of property with regard to divorce proceedings.
</p>
</section> <section class="published-paragraph">
<p>NY Dom. Rel. L. sec. 236 (2016) distinguishes "marital property" and "separate property" for purpose of divorce. Marital property means all property acquired by one or both parties during the marriage and before the execution of a separation agreement or the commencement of a matrimonial action. Marital property is subject to distribution in a divorce. "Separate property" encompasses property that is not subject to division. Separate property includes property acquired before marriage, property acquired by bequest, devise, or descent, property that is a gift from someone other than the spouse, compensation for personal injuries, property acquired in exchange for or the increase in value of separate property (except insofar as the appreciation of value is due to the contributions or efforts of the other spouse), and property described as separate property by written agreement of the parties.</p>

<section class="published-paragraph">
<p>Valid written agreements entered into prior to or during the marriage are enforceable with regard to property division. In cases without an agreement between the parties, property will be distributed under the principle of "equitable distribution." &nbsp;This does not mean that the property will be divided equally, but rather "equitably" in light of the following factors<span style="background-color: initial; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">:</span></p></section> 
<section class="published-paragraph">
<section class="shift-right">
<ol>
    <li>The income and property of each party at the time of marriage, and at the time of the commencement of the action;</li>
    <li>The duration of the marriage and the age and health of both parties;</li>
    <li>The need of the custodial parent to occupy or own the marital residence and to use or own its household effects;</li>
    <li>The loss of inheritance and pension rights upon dissolution of the marriage as of the date of dissolution;</li>
    <li>The loss of health insurance benefits upon dissolution of the marriage;</li>
    <li>Any award of maintenance [under New York law];</li>
    <li>Any equitable claim to, interest in, or indirect contribution made to the acquisition of any such marital property by the party not having title...;</li>
    <li>The liquid or non-liquid character of all marital property;</li>
    <li>The possible future financial circumstances of each party;</li>
    <li>The impossibility or difficulty of evaluating any component asset or any interest in a business, corporation[,] or profession, and the economic desirability of retaining such asset or interest intact and free from any claim or interference by the other party;</li>
    <li>The tax consequences to each party;</li>
    <li>The wasteful dissipation of assets by either spouse;</li>
    <li>Any transfer or encumbrance made by either party in contemplation of dissolution of the marriage; and</li>
    <li>Any other factor deemed relevant by the court.</li>
</ol>
</section>
</section> <section class="published-paragraph">

<p>The statute gives the court the discretion to find that equitable distribution is inappropriate or  would be impractical or burdensome in a given case.  This could be relevant in cases where the major assets at issue cannot be practically divided.  The court may have discretion in the latter cases to order a distributive award to achieve equity between the parties.</p>

<h4><strong>Property Division in New Jersey</strong></h4>
</section> <section class="published-paragraph">

<p>Like New York, New Jersey also uses the principle of equitable distribution for property division.  Furthermore, New Jersey makes a similar distinction between “marital property” and “separate property” as New York does.  Under NJ Rev Stat sec 2A:34-23.1 (2016), judges are required to consider the following non-exhaustive list of factors in determining equitable distribution in a given case (note that all references to “marriage” include “civil unions”):
</p>
</section> <section class="published-paragraph">
<section class="shift-right">

<ol>
    <li>The duration of the marriage;</li>
    <li>The age and physical and emotional health of the parties;</li>
    <li>The income or property brought to the marriage by each party;</li>
    <li>The standard of living established during the marriage;</li>
    <li>Any written agreement made before or during the marriage regarding property distribution;</li>
    <li>The economic circumstances of each party at the time the division of property becomes effective;</li>
    <li>The income and earning capacity of each party, including educational background, training, employment skills, work experience, length of absence from the job market, custodial responsibilities for children, and the time and expense necessary to acquire sufficient education or training to enable the party to become self-supporting at a standard of living reasonably comparable to that enjoyed during the marriage;</li>
    <li>The contribution by each party to the education, training, or earning power of the other;</li>
    <li>The contribution of each party to the acquisition, dissipation, preservation, depreciation or appreciation in the amount or value of the marital property, or the property acquired during the civil union as well as the contribution of a party as a homemaker;</li>
    <li>The tax consequences of the proposed equitable distribution to each party;</li>
    <li>The present value of the property;</li>
    <li>The need of the parent who has physical custody of a child to own or occupy the marital residence or residence ... and to use or own the household effects;</li>
    <li>The debts and liabilities of the parties;</li>
    <li>The need for creation, &nbsp;now or in the future, of a trust fund to secure reasonably foreseeable medical or educational costs for a spouse ... or children;</li>
    <li>The extent to which one party deferred to the other in achieving [his or her] &nbsp;career goals; and</li>
    <li>Any other factors deemed to be relevant by the court.</li>
</ol>

<p>Interestingly, agreements are to be considered under the list of New Jersey equitable distribution factors.</p>
