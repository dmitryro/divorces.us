<h3><strong>Contested Divorce</strong>
</h3>

<section class="published-paragraph">
<p>A contested divorce occurs when one party in the proceeding opposes a divorce action.  This can mean that one part does not want to get a divorce, disagrees on the grounds of divorce, or disagrees on important issues in a divorce such as child custody, the allocation of property/assets, or post-divorce support.

<p>A contested divorce can be a lengthy and – sometimes – contentious process.  Divorces are civil matters and a contested divorce may be resolved by a judge under the laws of the state in which it occurs.  For example, the New York Courts System advises that a contested divorce will require the parties to go to Supreme Court “numerous times.”  NJ Court Rule 5:1-4 explains that the length of time that it may take for a contested divorce to be resolved will depend upon the issues presented.  Certain matters may be placed on the “standard” track, whereas more complicated cases may be placed on the “Complex Track” and take longer.  Cases that involve custody or parenting-time issues may be placed on the “Priority Track” for expeditious adjudication of these issues in the best interest of the child(ren).

<p>In short, a contested divorce is a lawsuit.  It will involve pleadings, discovery motions, and potentially a trial before a judge (and in some cases, a jury).  It is extremely important to consult with an experienced divorce attorney if a divorce is contested, both to ensure that one’s interests are protected and that every avenue is explored for a potentially amicable solution (if appropriate).  Judges will make child custody determination, and either party can request that a judge make a determination on select other matters at issue in the divorce (such as property division or spousal support).

<p>In certain cases, it may be possible for the parties to reach a resolution without going to trial.  This can be accomplished through the parties coming to an agreement, whether through an informal process or through formal mediation.  Experienced family law attorneys may be able to help the parties see if there is a way to resolve the issues involved in the divorce without having to go through complex divorce proceedings.  However, certain cases may not be amenable to such a resolution.  Such cases may include those where one party is unwilling to negotiate, where the sides are too far apart on key issues, or situations where domestic violence is involved.
