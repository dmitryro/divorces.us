<p></p><section class="published-paragraph"><h3><strong>Adoption</strong></h3></section><section class="published-paragraph"><p>Choosing to adopt a child is a life-changing decision both for the adoptive parents and the adopted child. However, the process for adoption is not necessarily straightforward, and prospective adoptive parents must go through the proper procedures in order to complete an adoption. Here, we will provide a brief overview of adoptions in New York and New Jersey along with information about how the experienced family law attorneys at The Law Offices of Grinberg &amp; Segal, PLLC can help guide parents through the adoption process. This article is not intended to be in any way comprehensive, and individuals with case-specific questions should schedule a case-specific consultation.</p></section><section class="published-paragraph"><h4><strong>Adoption in New York</strong></h4></section><section class="published-paragraph"><p>Under New York law, unmarried adults, married adults, and unmarried adults who are living together may adopt a child. Two adults living together who seek to adopt a child may be of the same sex or different sexes. A person who is married but living separate and apart from his or her spouse under a separation decree, judgment, or divorce may adopt a child. Finally, an adult married person who has been living separate and apart from his or her spouse for at least three years may seek to adopt a child. It is worth noting that an adoption may not be denied on grounds of race; religion; fertility; gender preference; marital status; income; employment; or education.</p></section><section class="published-paragraph"><p>New York state law recognizes two distinct adoption procedures for adoptions that take place in New York State.</p></section><section class="published-paragraph"><p>First, there is the “agency adoption” process. In this process, an agency authorized by New York places a child in a home for adoption. To adopt a child under this process, the prospective parent(s) must work with an approved adoption agency. The agency will be required to screen prospective parent(s) to ensure that the child will be placed in a safe and suitable home environment. In order to commence the agency adoption process, the prospective parent(s) must file an application in court. After filing for adoption, parent(s) will be required to undergo what is called a “home study process.” The adoption agency will be required to assess the suitability of the prospective parent(s) to care for the specific child. Adoption proceedings require the submission to the court of extensive documentation establishing the suitability of the parent(s) and the eligibility of the child to be adopted. For this reason, adoptive parents are strongly advised to retain an experienced adoption attorney for guidance through the process.</p></section><section class="published-paragraph"><p>The second process is called the “private placement” process. Under this process, the child is put up for adoption by his or her birth parent(s) rather than by an authorized adoption agency. Accordingly, the prospective adoptive parent(s) must enter into an agreement with the birth parent(s). Parent(s) seeking to adopt a child through private placement will be required to obtain certification as qualified adoptive parents from a court of competent jurisdiction under New York law. The issues considered by the court for certification are similar to those considered in the agency adoption process. Also similarly, the adoption must be approved through adoption proceedings in court.</p></section><section class="published-paragraph"><p>In order to adopt a child who resides in the United States but not in New York state, prospective parent(s) will first have to obtain permission for the child to be moved in accordance with the provisions of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC).</p></section><section class="published-paragraph"><h4><strong>Adoptions in New Jersey</strong></h4></section><section class="published-paragraph"><p>In New Jersey, a single adult, married adults, or adults in a domestic partnership or civil union may adopt a child.</p></section><section class="published-paragraph"><p>Similar to New York, children in New Jersey may be adopted privately or through an approved adoption agency. If the prospective parent(s) are seeking to adopt from an approved agency, they will, as they would in New York, be required to undergo a home study. If the adoption agency determines that the prospective parent(s) are suitable, it may, in its discretion, attempt to match the parent(s) with a child who the agency believes would be a good fit in the home. Once a pairing is settled upon, New Jersey law requires that the child must reside with the prospective adoptive parent(s) for six months before they may file what is called a “complaint for adoption” with the court. The agency must also consent to this application. The court reviews the qualifications of the parents, the situation of the child, and renders a decision based on the agency’s report and whether the adoption would promote the best interests of the child.</p></section><section class="published-paragraph"><p>With regard to private adoptions, prospective parents are permitted to pay or reimburse the birth parent for medical, hospital, counseling, or other similar expenses in connection with the birth or any illness of the child, or any <em>reasonable&nbsp;</em>living expenses of the mother during her pregnancy. However, these payments may not continue beyond four weeks after the termination of the pregnancy by birth or otherwise. A prospective adoptive parent is well advised to consult with an experienced family law attorney for guidance on the rules surrounding such reimbursement.</p></section><section class="published-paragraph"><p>As is the case in New York, a parent in New Jersey seeking to adopt a child from out of state must first obtain permission for the child to move through the ICPC.</p></section>
