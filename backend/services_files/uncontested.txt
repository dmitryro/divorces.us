<strong>
<h3>Uncontested Divorce</h3>
</strong>

<section class="published-paragraph">
<p>An uncontested divorce results when the parties involved in a divorce agree on all of the pertinent issues without the need of  a trial, and the decree of divorce is entered by the court based upon the agreed upon uncontested terms.  The issues requiring agreement may include, but are not limited to:  the division of property and assets; spousal support and child support; and child custody.  The parties may reach such an agreement at the beginning of the process, through mediation, or at any time before a judge issues a final decision following a trial. Where practicable and where the parties can agree to fair terms, an uncontested divorce may save both sides money and the prospect of potentially acrimonious and protracted divorce proceedings.</p>
</section><section class="published-paragraph">
<p>Even if the divorce is uncontested, both parties must specify &nbsp;the specific ground of divorce under New York or New Jersey law (whichever is applicable). Both New York and New Jersey maintain similar lists of specified divorce grounds recognized under law.</p>
</section><section class="published-paragraph">
<p>If a party fails to respond to a divorce summons or complaint or a divorce summons with notice, a judge may issue a default judgment against that party, which will preclude that party from contesting the divorce and the terms specified in the summons, complaint, or summons with notice.

<h4><strong><b>Uncontested Divorce in New York</b></strong></h4>
</section><section class="published-paragraph">
<p>A divorce in New York may be uncontested if the parties agree on the legal grounds for divorce and reach a settlement of all the issues without judicial proceedings.  It is possible to reach such an amicable agreement either at the very start or through ensuing mediation.  The most common ground for divorce in uncontested cases is the irreconcilable differences ground.  However, the uncontested divorce may be based on any of the legally sufficient grounds.</p>

<h4><strong>Uncontested Divorce in New Jersey</strong></h4>
</section><section class="published-paragraph">
<p>Uncontested divorces in New Jersey work similarly to uncontested divorces in New York.  The parties may seek an uncontested divorce if they can agree on issues involving property and assets, children, and spousal support.  Under the NJ Court Rule 5:1-4, an uncontested divorce where the parties have reached an agreement and where the parties were married for less than five years may be placed on the expedited track. Expedited track cases may be resolved more quickly than other cases.

<p></p><p>Uncontested divorces are not possible or necessarily
advisable in every case.&nbsp; However, where

save time, money, and allow both sides to amicably move on with their
lives.&nbsp; Uncontested divorces are
generally more likely in cases where the parties do not have significant assets
