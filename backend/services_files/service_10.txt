</section> <section class="published-paragraph">

A judge may issue such and order, which prohibits the abusive party from contact with a spouse or child and/or from engaging in certain activities.  Both New York and New Jersey have specific statutes regarding such orders. This article will provide a brief intr<b>od<b>ucti</b>o</b>n to the issue.</p>

<h4>Orders of Protection in New York</h4>
</section> <section class="published-paragraph">

<p>The provisions regarding orders of protection in New York are found in NY Dom Rel L sec. 240 (2016).
</p>
</section> <section class="published-paragraph">

<p>Under this statute, an order of protection or temporary order of protection may be entered against one party in a divorce proceeding as part of a final judgment of divorce, in child custody/visitation proceedings, or prior to or subsequent to the entry of a final judgment.  An order of protection entered during divorce proceedings may remain in effect after a final judgment.  The order of protection need not necessarily be based on conduct that happened contemporaneously with the request.  The protected party cannot be held to violate an order of protection in effect against the abusive party.

<p>The statute lists conduct that an order of protection may require from any party:
