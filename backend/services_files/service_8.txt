<h3>Mediation</h3><p>Through mediation, the parties may come to an agreement on how to resolve contentious issues relating to a divorce without having to go to trial.  Mediation may be appropriate in cases where there is enough common ground between the parties to resolve the issues without a judge.  Furthermore, pursuing a divorce agreement through mediation may lead to a more amicable settlement than what would be possible in court proceedings.  However, mediation may not be possible in every case. In cases where the parties are too far apart, where one party is unwilling to negotiate, or where there has been domestic violence, divorce mediation may not be a viable option.</p>

<p>If you decide to retain an attorney for divorce mediation, his or her role will be different than in adversarial proceedings before a court.    The job of the attorney in divorce mediation is to represent you in working with the other party to reach an agreement that is acceptable to both sides on all of the issues related to divorce, while ensuring that your rights and interests are protected.  An expert family law attorney can be an indispensable asset in the mediation setting with his or her experience and knowledge of the relevant state laws.  For example, an experienced family law attorney will be able to assist clients in achieving, among other things, an equitable division of assets, mutually agreeable child custody terms, and appropriate child and  spousal support payments,  all while taking into account  your best interests in light of the financial and other relevant implications of the sensitive issues being discussed in the mediated dissolution of the marriage.</p>
