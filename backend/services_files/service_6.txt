<h3><strong>Divorce and Domestic Violence</strong></h3>
<p>There is no more urgent cause for divorce or legal separation than domestic violence and/or abusive conduct by one partner of the marriage toward his or her spouse and/or child(ren).  The experienced family law attorneys at the Law Offices of Grinberg &amp; Segal, PLLC stand ready to offer their expert counsel and compassion to a client who has suffered domestic violence in his or her marriage and who is dealing with the fallout from the violence and abuse in his or her divorce proceedings.</p></section><section class="published-paragraph">
<h4><strong>New York and New Jersey Divorce Grounds Involving Domestic Violence</strong></h4>
<p>Both the New York and New Jersey State divorce laws include domestic violence against a spouse as a legal ground for divorce.
</p>
<p>New York State law defines “cruel and inhuman” treatment of the plaintiff by the defendant as a ground for divorce.  In order to satisfy the statute, the cruel and inhuman treatment must endanger the plaintiff’s “physical or mental well-being” such that it renders it unsafe or improper for the plaintiff to continue cohabiting with the defendant. NY Dom Rel L sec. 170 (2016).</p></section><section class="published-paragraph">
<p>New Jersey State law includes conduct constituting “extreme cruelty” towards the plaintiff by the defendant as a ground for divorce.  The statutory definition includes both “physical and mental cruelty,”   which must either endanger the safety or health of the plaintiff or make it improper or unreasonable to expect the plaintiff to continue to cohabit with the defendant. &nbsp;NJ Rev Stat sec. 2A:34-2 (2016). New Jersey also includes as a divorce ground “deviant sexual conduct” performed by the defendant without the consent of the plaintiff..

<h4><strong>Other Family Law Concerns Involving Domestic Violence</strong></h4>
<p>Before pursuing divorce, it is crucial for a victim of domestic violence to ensure his or her safety.  An experienced attorney will be able to guide the domestic violence victim in obtaining potentially necessary forms of relief, such as an order of protection.  In proceedings, an attorney can help ensure that the victim’s address and personal information will be kept from his or her abuser.
</p>

<p>Indeed, domestic violence often complicates divorce actions in that the circumstances of abuse and cruelty may make it impossible to resolve issues through out-of-court mediation rather than through formal court proceeding.  In such cases, an experienced attorney can help the victim defend his or her safety and future in court.
</p>
<p>If a party to divorce proceedings presents evidence that he or she was the victim of domestic violence, many aspects of the ultimate resolution of the divorce petition can be affected.  This may be true even if the domestic violence is not the ground upon which the divorce is based.  The following is a non-exhaustive list of matters that may be affected by allegations or evidence of spousal domestic violence or cruelty:
</p>
<section class="shift-right">
<ul>
    <li>Child custody/visitation determinations (evidence of domestic violence against either the parent or child will be considered in custody and visitation determinations);</li>
    <li>Child support;</li>
    <li>Alimony/spousal support (<i>e.g., </i>NY Dom Rel L sec. 236 (2016) provides that domestic violence will be considered in any temporary maintenance determination insofar as the domestic violence inhibited or continues to inhibit the victim’s capacity to gain employment);</li>
    <li>Allocation of marital assets.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other unique issues may also arise depending on the facts and the state.  For example, in New Jersey, divorced couples with children are generally required to undergo a “Parent’s Education program” in order to promote cooperation between divorced parents with regard to child rearing. NJ Rev Stat sec. 2A:34-12.3 (2016). However, the statute recognizes that the “cooperation may sometimes be inappropriate in cases of domestic violence.”</p>
